### Transation Analyzer 

This is a web application that lets you analyze your spending 
- One may set-up all their bank accounts via Plaid and be able to analyze your spending
- One can also upload (.csv) files with transactions. For example, Apple card does not allow third-party integrations so there is no way to pull the Txs in real-time.


### Objectives

- I am learning AI as a part of this project. By using a smart model to categorize my spend
- I am learning software development and new tools as a part of this project
- I want this tool for personal use


### Future Scope 

- Distributed Tracing (be able to understand how much time is taken by the requests)
- API Gateaway (leverage rate-limiting and auth offered by the API Gateway)
- Sessions? Evaluate if needed and how those could be utilized
